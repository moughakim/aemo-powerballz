// Absolutely! "Fran" is one of the classic CrossFit 
// workouts and is known for its intensity. 
// It consists of thrusters and pull-ups, specifically: - 21-15-9 reps of: - Thrusters (95/65 lbs) - 
// Pull-Ups ### Pull-Up Strategy **1. Movement 
// Division:** For the pull-ups, a good strategy would be to break them down
//  into manageable sets to avoid failure. Hereâ€™s a possible 
//  breakdown: - **21 Pull-Ups:** - Try 3 sets: 7-7-7 or 6-6-6-6-3 (adjust based on your strength and fatigue) -
//   **15 Pull-Ups:** - 2 sets: 8-7 or 5-5-5 (again, adjust as necessary) - **9 Pull-Ups:** 
//   - 1 set (or 5-4 if you're feeling fatigued) **2. Time Management:** Depending on your fitness level, 
//     here's an estimate for how long you might take for the pull-ups: - For the **21 Pull-Ups**: 1-2 minutes - 
//     For the **15 Pull-Ups**: 1-1.5 minutes - For the **9 Pull-Ups**: 30 seconds - 
//     1 minute This adds up to approximately 2.5 to 4.5 minutes for the pull-up portions of the workout. 
//     ### Rest Periods **Resting is crucial
//     ** to maintain intensity throughout the workout. 
//     A general guideline for rest can be: - 
//     **After each set of Pull-Ups
//     **: Take a rest period that allows you to feel recovered but not too long to lose momentum. 
//     For example: - After the 21 pull-ups: Rest about 1 minute or until your heart rate drops enough to continue. 
//     - After the 15 pull-ups: Same as above, about 30 seconds to 1 minute. 
//     - After the 9 pull-ups: 30 seconds or as needed. 
//     ### Summary 1. 
//     **Pull-Up Breakdown**: - 21: 7-7-7 - 15: 8-7 - 9: 9 (or 5-4 if fatigued) 2. 
//     **Estimated Time**: - Pull-Ups: 2.5 to 4.5 minutes total 3. 
//     **Rest**: - 1 minute after 21; up to 1 minute after 15; 30 seconds after 9. 
//     Remember to listen to your body. 
//     If you feel fatigued and need a longer rest, take it, but try to stay engaged mentally during recovery. 
//     Good luck, and most importantly, 
//     have fun with "Fran"!
